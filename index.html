 	<p>New York City is and has been a city of significant immigration for much of its history. However, in recent years, there seems to be a trend of gentrification of old immigrant outposts.  Since the 1990s, Williamsburg, Greenpoint and Chinatown have all had the median income consistently increase while the total level of immigrants as a percentage of the whole population has decreased.  Some of these changes have been <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/williamsburg-brooklyn-gentrification-in-3-maps-2013-12">well documented</a> over the past 20 years, while others are just coming to light.</p>

 	<p>Williamsburg-Greenpoint is <a href="http://gizmodo.com/tracking-brooklyns-rapid-fire-gentrification-with-googl-1594799132">a compelling case</a>, as it's often referred to as the hot seat of gentrification in the United States. From 2000 to 2013, the average annual income per capita in Williamsburg-Greenpoint climbed over $11,000, adjusted to inflation. Additionally, during the same period, the foreign-born population of the neighborhood dropped from 34% to 24%. As the income in Williamsburg-Greenpoint goes up, so do housing prices, which can force out immigrants communities who have been stakeholders for years.</p>
	<p>In both Chinatown and Williamsburg-Greenpoint, per-capita income has risen to around the $30,000 level, a jump of nearly $10,000 in both neighborhoods in a 13 year span. These are not only a sign of gentrification at work, it could also point to why new immigrants and older foreign-born people who had lived in the area are being economically pushed out. Additionally, the data indicates that in Williamsburg-Greenpoint, the population has actually increased by 10,000 people from 2000 to 2013, while the foreign born population has dropped. This could indicate a data backup for the well-documented trend of wealthier American citizens making Williamsburg-Greenpoint the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/12/nyregion/for-good-or-bad-watching-williamsburgs-transformation.html?_r=0">capital of United States gentrification</a>.</p>

 	<p>While our areas are different in terms of their foreign born countries of origin, trends over the past 13 years show striking similarities to one another.  In Chinatown in 2000, 40% of the population was foreign-born, with 60% of immigrants coming from China.  However in the ensuing 13 years, the foreign-born population dropped to 35.5% and the Chinese born population dropped to 54%.  Across the East River in Williamsburg-Greenpoint, a historically Polish area, the Polish population dropped from comprising 32.3% of the immigrant population of the neighborhood to just 23.7%. Many of them moved to Ridgewood, in New Jersey, a cheaper Polish community.</p>
